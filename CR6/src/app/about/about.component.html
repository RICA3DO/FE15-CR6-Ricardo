    <p>The French, Spanish and Austrians also had a considerable influence on Italian food. As an example, Spanish invaders introduced the tomato. This vegetable soon served as the foundation of Italy`s delicious cuisine. The Austrians introduced locals to Spritz, an aperitif that spread like wildfire throughout Italy. The Arabs introduced Sicilians to the dish that later evolved into marzipan. This tasty creation quickly became an uber-popular dessert. It is also thought that the Arabs introduced cassata as well. Cassata is a cake made with sugar, royal paste, sheep ricotta and candied fruit. The Arabs also introduced Sicilians to sugar cane, oranges, lemon and an array of other foods.</p>

    <p>Ask anyone about Italian food and most will quickly reference pizza. The original version of this scrumptious food was quite simple compared to today`s elaborate concoctions. Pizza`s origins date all the way back to 1889 when King Umberto I and Queen Margherita traveled to Naples. The country`s best pizzaiolo was asked to create pizza for these royal visitors. His best creation was rather basic, consisting of dough, mozzarella cheese, tomato and basil. He created this style of pizza in honor of Italy`s national colors. Queen Margherita enjoyed the pizza to the point that she wrote a letter of gratitude to the pizzaiolo, inspiring him to call the pie “pizza margherita”. This simple but delicious version of pizza is still consumed across the globe today and will likely continue to be cherished by the masses for years to come.</p>
